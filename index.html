            It all started in 2016 when we officially launched the system of
            file sharing. We boast HD quality as well as fast download speed. To
            provide our users with multiple choices, we use links from third
            party sources like mp4upload, vidstream, streamtape, mycloud. Your
            Favorite Anime is available for live streaming and can reach a huge
            number of audiences around the world. The demand for Japanese anime
            has steadily been on the rise recently all over the world. When
            9anime was shut down for the first time, multiple fake copies that
            are prone to viruses and malware came into existence. For your
            utmost safety, visit our official 9anime website only.

          <h1 class="about-heading">What is wrong with 9anime?</h1>
          <p class="about-text">
            Not everyone knows that anime is not only short animation. Thanks to
            the widespread promotion of Japanese newspapers and television, more
            and more people from four corners of the Earth know about this
            Japanese art subject. In its home country, Japan, 33% of people
            watch anime (out of 125 million, that's more than 40 million). Most
            great anime series are based on well-known comics (manga), games, or
            ranobe. 9anime hosts a huge collection of anime with topics suitable
            for all ages and genders. No matter what genre you are in the mood
            for, you can find it here on 9anime.

            <h1 class="about-heading">Is KissAnime better than 9anime?</h1>
            <p class="about-text">
              The fact that 9anime is new doesn't make it less competitive. The 9anime team has learnt from KissAnime's mistakes to create a site with better quality content library and much more outstanding updates than KissAnime. Titles you cannot find on 9anime are highly unlikely to be found anywhere else. 9anime is the easiest and fastest place to connect you with your titles of interest.
